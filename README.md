Detailed description about scrum


================
Waterfall model
================
The Waterfall model is the earliest SDLC approach that was used for software development. The waterfall Model illustrates the software development process in a linear sequential flow. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete. In "The Waterfall" approach, the whole process of software development is divided into separate phases. In this Waterfall model, typically, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.

=======
Phases
=======
Requirement Analysis -> System Design -> Implementation -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintainence

======
Some situations where the use of Waterfall model is most appropriate are −
- Requirements are very well documented, clear and fixed.
- Product definition is stable.
- Technology is understood and is not dynamic.
- There are no ambiguous requirements.
- Ample resources with required expertise are available to support the product.
- The project is short.

===========
Advantages
===========
The advantages of waterfall development are that it allows for departmentalization and control. A schedule can be set with deadlines for each stage of development and a product can proceed through the development process model phases one by one. Development moves from concept, through design, implementation, testing, installation, troubleshooting, and ends up at operation and maintenance. Each phase of development proceeds in strict order. Some of the major advantages of the Waterfall Model are as follows −
- Simple and easy to understand and use
- Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model. Each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.
- Phases are processed and completed one at a time.
- Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood.
- Clearly defined stages.
- Well understood milestones.
- Easy to arrange tasks.
- Process and results are well documented.

==============
Disadvantages
==============
Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well-documented or thought upon in the concept stage. The major disadvantages of the Waterfall Model are as follows −
- No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.
- High amounts of risk and uncertainty.
- Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects.
- Poor model for long and ongoing projects.
- Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing. So, risk and uncertainty is high with this process model.
- It is difficult to measure progress within stages.
- Cannot accommodate changing requirements.
- Adjusting scope during the life cycle can end a project.
- Integration is done as a "big-bang. at the very end, which doesn't allow identifying any technological or business bottleneck or challenges early.

======
There can be change in the requirements that affect the deadline. Defects can be found too late. People pinching delays progress: If A project has key members to deliever the project, but suddenly managers from other projects start taking those people out of project A and put them into project B.

======
AGILE
======
AGILE methodology is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project. Both development and testing activities are concurrent unlike the Waterfall model. The ultimate value in Agile development is that it enables teams to deliver value faster, with greater quality and predictablity, and greater aptitude to respond to change. Scrum and Kanban are two of the most widely used Agile methodologies. 

======
Agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it. It focused on the left items than right items.
Indiviuals and interactions 		OVER 		Processes and tools
Working software					OVER		Comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration				OVER		Contract negotiation
Reponding to change					OVER 		Following a plan

===========
Advantages
===========
- Release few features early
- make some early return on investment
- discover potential issues early
- changes requirement often
- react to change through replanning
- lightweight/ simple solutions

=======
SCRUMS
=======
Framework for developing and sustaining complex products. Scrum consist of self organizing cross functional teams means group of people having expertese in different fields come together to make a product. Product manager does not control them, since they can take decisions collectively.

======
Scrum is not a process or a technique for building the products, but is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques.

=============
Scrum Theory
=============
Based on empirical process control theory: iterative or incremental. It consists of three principles: Transperency(done means done), 
Inspection(Check on progress), 
Adaption(Change the product based on inspection). 

Empiricism is all about learning from the mistakes from the past.

===============
Scrum Skeleton
===============
Product Backlog: List of all the features and their acceptance creteria.

Sprint Backlog: Subset of Product backlog. It is taken by teams, broken down in tasks and worked in a iteration called Sprint.

Sprint: Sprint is a period of time less than 30 days or less than a calender month and in that time the team work on that task until they develop a working increment of the product.

Daily scrum meeting: It represents the fact that every day the team meet to inspect the progress and adapt their plan for the day in a day scrum meeting.

Sprint retrospective: When the sprint finishes, team then discuss transperantly their progress so they can improve improve on the things that need to be improvement or retain things that are going well.

======
Transperency: Learning from past mistakes, improving, making new decisions, making changes adapting. Having the trust with the team, if something is done it is really done. So team should share the common definition of done.

======
Inspection: should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work. Defining the frequency of inspection. Week is too short, but 2 weeks seems to be a good option mostly. Setting the length of the sprint is very important. It gives enough chances for inspection.

=============
SCRUM EVENTS
=============
Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events section of this document:
• Sprint Planning
• Daily Scrum
• Sprint Review
• Sprint Retrospective

You can't take away any above mentioned step as it will take away from the scrum. There can also be another event called product backlog grooming but above mentioned four has to be there.

=============
Scrum Values 
=============
When the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone.

=================
Scrum Team Roles
=================
Consists of three parts: Scrum Master, Product Owner and Development Team.

======
Scrum Master's purpose is to understand the scrum rules and practices, remove any impediments or blockers to the team delivering and to help the team to understand how to self organize and work in scrum manner. Scrum master facilitates the scrum team wherever it makes sense to do so. Scrum master is your go to guy in terms of how the scrum framework should operate and this applies to anyone in the organization. Scrum master usually understands how to aid the product owner in maximizing return on investment and helps the team to work together to be productive as humanly possible and deliver the releasable increment. In some situations scrum master need not be present in the meeting. In place he/she can set up the meeting. Scrum master move the team towards self organizing. Scrum master is the servent-leader for the scrum team. Meaning by serving the team you are also leading the team. Facilitating Scrum events as required or needed. Removing impediments for the developemnt's progress. Stakeholders no need to be talking to the development team. Scrum master has the authority to coach anyone in the organization. Scrum master has authority on the scrum not on the people.

======
Product owner is responsible for creating the requirement on behalf of the business. He prioritizes based on the business needs and is responsible for managing the product backlog. Product backlog is the least of all the features that the business requires in the finished product. Is responsible for making decisions that maximize return on investment and for making priority calls or tradeoffs to maximize the product value. Product owner is responsible, he may not be accountable(not always) but responsible. Product owner's decision should be respected in the organization.

======
Development Team: responsible for building a potentially releasable product increment in each sprint. There are only these three roles. It does not go into the specifies of all the different possible knowledge experts within the development. Development team is selft organizing and collaborative as well as skilled in whatever is needed. They look to scrum master for the guidance and removal of impediments. They look to product owner for clear requirements, prioritization and trade off. 
Team size is one of the most important factor. Scrum teams are small because it helps them to be more cohesive and communicate efficiently. Optimum size of team is between 3 and 9.
Development team is part of scrum team. Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than developer, regardless of the work being performed by the person. Even designers, testers, develpers are part of development team as they are helping in developing the product.

======
Key points: A working increment is delivered each sprint. A piece of product is "done" according to the teams definition of "done". Includes "RULES" defined by TEAM. Correctly tested product. Design standards met. 

======
Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint. Fewer than three Development Team members decrease interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. Smaller Development Teams may encounter skill constraints during the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to deliver a potentially releasable Increment. Having more than nine members requires too much coordination

===========
TIME BOXES
===========
Time box is a period of time dedicated to a specific event in scrum. Part of the scrum master's role is to carry out time management very strictly it means starting and ending the meeting on time and helping the team to increase the productivity. Time boxes are the events. It is scrum master's role to organize and facilitate all these events.

=======
Sprint: It is a period of time less than a calender month during which team build a releasable increment of product. Another sprint starts immediately when one sprint gets over. It specifically can't go into days but specifically into the calender month. Only product owner has the authority to cancel the sprint.

Sprint planning meeting: the developemnt team planned the work they will do in the upcoming sprint. The meeting last long no more than eight hours a month sprint or 4 hours for 2 week sprint. There are two topics discussed in the meeting: What and How. What are the features that product owner would like development team to deliver from the backlog. he explains and ask questions from them. Eventually they can pick the features they believe they can commit to the sprint. How: they device the feature into subtask and estimate them. Finally development team will decide which task they are gonna deliever in the sprint.

Development Team capacity: The input to this meeting is product backlog. The latest product increment projected the capacity of the development team during the sprint. Time available - factored unavailable time(lunch, meetings) = capacity.

Sprint goal: is an objective that will be met within the sprint through the implementation of product backlog.

Daily Scrum: Daily meeting last no longer than 15 minutes one by one each development team member answers what's done yesterday, what has to be done today, any impediments. Scrum master may note all the impediments and try to resolve them asap. Sprint backlog and sprint burn down should be visible to draw attention to team's progress or any impediments. It happens at the same place to reduce complexity. Scrum master ensures that the development team has the meeting, but the development team is responsible for conducting the daily scrum.

Sprint Review: It helds at the end of each sprint and allows team to demo the part of product to product owner and stakeholders. Stakeholders make ask questons and have the suggestions to product owner. It is 4 hours maximum time boxed meeting.

Sprint Retrospective: meeting held after the sprint review and before the next sprint. What worked int this sprint and what can be improved in next sprint. Chance for the team to inspect and adapt. It is 3 hours for a month sprint.

Velocity: the pace at which the team has worked. This can be used to calculate how many features are likely to be completed by release date

================
Product Backlog
================
List of all the features that product owner would like to see in the finished product. This list constantly evolves and changes over time. Product owner works with the stakeholders to form requirements. He also works with team to get suggestions, technical input and estimates. A number of features that the product owner would like to release is referred to as a release backlog (subset of product backlog). 

======
Product backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product backlog. Refinement is the word used in place of grooming now in latest scrum guide.

==================
Release burn down
==================
Monitoring the progress of release: the release burn down is a common method for monitoring progress towards the release of a product. It shows number of story points and sprints remaining till launch. Check if project is on track. It has to be diagonal. Story points in y axis and sprint numbers in x axis

===============
Sprint backlog
===============
Is the set of items the development team work in a sprint to deliever the increment. It is selection from product backlog picked by product owner but finally committed by development team. It consist of features, tasks and  their estimates monitoring the progress of a sprint burn down. As release burn down burns the sprint burn down helps the scrum team monitor progress within a sprint. Vertical axis shows number of hours or tasks and is related to number of tasks remaining in the sprint backlog. Horizontal axis shows number of days in sprint. Definition of done can be changed and agreed upon every start of the sprint.

======
Only the development team can change the sprint backlog during sprint. or product owner has to negotiate with the team and vice verca on sprint changes, but team has the final say about those stories.

======
Sprint burn down is not the only way to monitor a sprint.

======
Sprint backlog needs to include one improvement from the Sprint Retrospective with regards to how the team works.  This is to ensure that each sprint is focussing on continuous improvement!

================
Scrum Artifacts
================
Scrum artifact represent work or value to provide transparency and oppurtunities for inspection and adaption. Artifacts defined by scrum are specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody has the same understanding of the artifact

======
There are three artifacts: 	Product backlog, sprint backlog, increment

================
Scrum of Scrums
================
The Scrum of scrums is a method of co-ordinating teams and is used to grow and synchronise the scrum framework
within a company to huge scale. As a scrum master I have used this technique to great effect in order to keep complex inter-related projects in sync. 

======
The scrum of scrums is a meeting held to co-ordinate a set of inter-related scrum teams. The power and ability to scale is in the fact that one representative from each related team attends the scrum of scrums meeting. By doing this an organisation can co-ordinate hundreds of people on different teams.

======
In this meeting, the host asks four questions (in the same vein as the daily scrum meeting). The questions are:
1. What have you accomplished since the last meeting
2. What do you aim to accomplish before the next meeting
3. Are there any impediments/blockers in your way
4. Are you about to do anything that could create a blocker/impediment to the project

======
Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items may then be employed. Only one product backlog should be used even for multiple teams working together on same project.

======
Even expanding the number of teams should not cause a break in the scrum rules. The rules actually aid better development by maintaining the framework.

===========================
DoD vs Acceptance Criteria
===========================
Definition of Done (DoD) is a list of requirements that a user story must adhere to for the team to call it complete. While the Acceptance Criteria of a User Story consist of set of Test Scenarios that are to be met to confirm that the software is working as expected.

The difference between these two is that the DoD is common for all the User Stories whereas the Acceptance Criteria is applicable to specific User Story. Acceptance Criteria of each User Story will be different based on the requirements of that User Story.

In other words, Both DoD and Acceptance Criteria must be met in order to complete the User Story.  The Product Increment is not considered to be complete, unless both these two lists are done
